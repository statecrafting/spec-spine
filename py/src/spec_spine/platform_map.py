"""Spec: specs/007-python-distribution/spec.md (extends 006-distribution).

The single (os, cpu) -> target table for the Python/uvx channel, plus host
detection and the unsupported-host message. This is the Python-side mirror of
npm/lib/platform.js's SUPPORTED map and the §3.2 table in spec 006: the five
triples, the in-archive binary name, and the per-target wheel platform tag are
ONE FACT, and this module is its home on the Python side. A drift between this
table, release.yml's matrix, install.sh's detection, and npm/lib/platform.js is
a governed change (spec 006 §2, now four places).

Pure data + pure functions: no filesystem or network on the mapping path, so the
table is unit-tested directly (test/test_platform_map.py). Used by three
consumers: scripts/generate_wheels.py (publish time), _refuse.py (runtime, on the
unsupported path), and the tests.
