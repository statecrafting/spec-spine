"""spec-spine: Python/uvx distribution.

On a supported host you never import this package: pip/uv select a platform
wheel whose only payload is the prebuilt `spec-spine` binary in the wheel's
scripts directory, so `spec-spine`/`uvx spec-spine` runs the native binary with
no Python in the path. This importable package ships only in the sdist, which is
built solely on hosts with no matching wheel (musl, win-arm64, 32-bit), where its
`spec-spine` entry point prints a clear refusal (see _refuse.py). Spec:
specs/007-python-distribution/spec.md.
