"""Spec: specs/007-python-distribution/spec.md §3.4 (unsupported hosts fail clearly).

The `spec-spine` console entry point shipped by the sdist. It is reached only on
a host with no prebuilt wheel (musl/Alpine, win-arm64, 32-bit, ...), because on a
supported host the platform wheel's bundled binary IS the `spec-spine` command
and this module is never installed. Its whole job is to name the host, explain
why there is no binary, and point at the source-build escape hatch -- the exact
posture of npm/lib/platform.js's unsupported-host message. It never tries to run
anything; it exits non-zero.
