# NNN: Title

## 1. Purpose

What problem this spec solves and what it owns.

## 2. Territory

The units this spec claims authority over (mirrors the frontmatter edges, in prose).

## 3. Behavior

What the governed code must do. Use MUST/SHOULD/MAY.

## 4. Out of scope

What this spec deliberately does not cover.
