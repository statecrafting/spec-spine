summary: >
  The PR-time coupling gate (spec-spine.md guardrail 2): cross-reference every
  changed code path against the authority graph and refuse the merge when code
  drifts from the spec that owns it. A pure function of (config, registry, index,
  diff, waiver); the CLI parses `git diff --no-color -U0 --no-renames base...head`
  (quotepath off, end-of-options) into a typed DiffInput so git stays out of core.
  Matches a diff hunk to its owning unit at
  file, section, and symbol granularity; is amends-aware with the FR-005
  strict-expansion guard; transfers authority across supersedes; honors PR-body
  waivers and an additive bypass list. Establishes the couple engine and the
  `spec-spine couple` subcommand.

# 005: The coupling gate

## 1. Purpose

The registry (spec 001) is the spec-as-source view; the index (spec 004) is the
code-as-source view. They are inverses. This gate **joins them at PR time** and
refuses the merge when a changed code path is not accompanied by an edit to a
spec that has authority over it (spec-spine.md guardrail 2). It is the mechanical
enforcement that catches silent drift before it lands.

The behavioral semantics are ported **intact** from OAP
`tools/spec-spine/spec-code-coupling-check` (`lib.rs:legitimate_owners`,
`is_bypass_against`, `claim_matches`, `parse_waiver`, `span_overlaps_hunk`,
`build_unit_claim_index`): the single most battle-tested algorithm in the
references. The structure around it is fresh; the behavior is re-derived, not
reinvented.

## 2. Territory

`spec-spine-core`'s `couple.rs` (the pure engine + the `DiffInput` / `Waiver` /
`CoupleReport` DTOs), the `spec-spine couple` CLI subcommand (`cmd_couple.rs`,
which owns the `git diff` invocation and PR-body read), and their tests. The gate
additively extends the core library surface (`lib.rs`) and the CLI dispatch
(`main.rs`).

## 3. Behavior

### 3.1 The boundary: git stays out of core

Core exposes two pure entry points (no clock, no env, no git):

- `couple(cfg, repo_root, diff, waiver)`: the freshness-guarded form: it checks
  the committed index is fresh, loads `registry.json` + `index.json` from
  `derived_dir`, and delegates to `couple_with`.
- `couple_with(cfg, registry, index, diff, waiver)`: the pure form for callers
  that already hold the artifacts (overlays, tests).

The CLI runs `git -c core.quotepath=false diff --no-color -U0 --no-renames
--end-of-options <base>...<head>`, parses it into a typed `DiffInput` (per-file
new-side hunk line-spans), reads the PR body for a waiver, and calls `couple`. A
`DiffInput` file with **no hunks** (a deletion, or `--paths-from` mode) denotes a
whole-file change that overlaps every span. Three flags harden the diff against
gate evasion and injection: `--no-renames` makes a rename surface as a delete of
the old path plus an add of the new path (both whole-file changes the gate
evaluates), so moving a governed file with `git mv` cannot bypass coupling;
`core.quotepath=false` keeps a non-ASCII/space path literal so it still matches
its owning unit instead of arriving as an octal-quoted, unmatched string; and
`--end-of-options` guarantees a `<base>`/`<head>` ref that begins with `-` is
treated as an operand, never as a git option.

### 3.2 Owner derivation: three granularities

The *legitimate owners* of a changed `(path, hunk)` are the union of two sources,
joined under the primary-owner heuristic (any one owner clears):

1. **Unit-resolved ownership** (span-aware): for every ownership-bearing
   `resolvedUnit` in the index whose location file matches `path` and whose span
   overlaps the hunk:
   - **file** unit → `span` is absent ⇒ whole file ⇒ overlaps every hunk. A
     trailing-slash directory path prefix-matches every file beneath it.
   - **section** unit → the anchor's resolved line-span; overlaps iff the hunk's
     line range intersects it.
   - **symbol** unit → the symbol's resolved line-span; same overlap rule.
2. **Path-level ownership** (whole-file): for every `implementingPath` whose
   claim matches `path` (exact, or directory prefix for a package directory).
   This carries the manifest-metadata and comment-header linkages.

Span overlap uses inclusive 1-based ranges aligned with `git diff -U0`
(`span_overlaps_hunk`); a `None` span (whole file) overlaps unconditionally.

### 3.3 Amends-awareness and the strict-expansion guard (FR-005)

When the changed path is exactly `specs/<id>/spec.md`, the owner set is
**expanded** to include every spec that `amends` `<id>` (and the amended spec's
`amendment_record` target, when present), **but only if the base owner set is
non-empty**. This is the FR-005 strict-expansion guard: amends may add owners to
an already-firing path; it must never silently enrol a path that has no owner
today, or editing your own spec while an unrelated amender exists would newly
fire. The set strictly expands; it never shrinks.

In practice a `specs/<id>/spec.md` path has no base owner (no spec claims another
spec's source of truth), so it is skipped as unclaimed; editing a spec is always
permitted. The guard is what makes that safe.

### 3.4 Supersedes: authority transfer

`supersedes` transfers current authority to the superseding spec: if spec `S`
supersedes spec `P`, then `S` joins the legitimate owners of every path/unit `P`
owns (derived from the registry's `supersedes` edges joined to the index's
resolved ownership). The transfer is **additive**: `S` is added, `P` is not
removed, preserving the "strictly expands, never removes" contract, so editing
either the predecessor or the successor clears the path.

### 3.5 Clearance, waivers, and bypass

- **Clearance**: a path is cleared when **any one** of its legitimate owners has
  its `specs/<owner-id>/spec.md` in the diff. An owned path with no owner edit is
  a **drift violation**, emitted with code `C-001` (the coupling band of the
  shared `V`/`L`/`I`/`C` diagnostic scheme, see `docs/design/00-architecture.md`
  §10.3).
- **Bypass**: a path exempt from the gate is skipped. The match rules
  (`is_bypass_against`): trailing `/` ⇒ directory prefix; leading `**/` ⇒
  tail-suffix anywhere in the tree; else exact file. The effective bypass set is
  a **hardcoded generic floor** (`couple.rs::DEFAULT_BYPASS_PREFIXES`, the single
  built-in source) unioned with `config.coupling.bypass_prefixes`: the adopter
  list is **additive and cannot remove a floor entry**. Because the floor is
  always unioned in, the config default is **empty**: an adopter declares only
  their additions, never a copy of the floor.
- **Waiver**: the gate reads the first PR-body line beginning with
  `config.coupling.waiver_keyword` (default `Spec-Drift-Waiver:`); the trimmed
  remainder is the reason. A present waiver suppresses the failure exit but the
  violations are **retained** in the report for review-time visibility.
- **Dependency-only auto-waiver** (amendment 2026-06-11; opt-in via
  `config.coupling.auto_waive_dependency_only`, default `false`): dependabot-class
  PRs bump version strings inside `package.json` dependency tables but can edit
  neither specs nor PR bodies, so an owned manifest fires `C-001` with no waiver
  path available. When opted in and **no explicit PR-body waiver is present**,
  the CLI compares the parsed base/head JSON of every non-bypassed changed path
  (contents fetched at the **merge base** and head; the diff is three-dot): if
  all are `package.json` manifests that are semantically identical except
  version strings inside `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/
  `optionalDependencies`/`peerDependencies` (same package keys; values may
  differ only where both sides are strings), the gate synthesizes a waiver
  (`core::dep_only`, reason marks it mechanical) and reports the violations as
  auto-waived. Anything else (a new or removed package, a `scripts` edit,
  spec-binding metadata, an added table, an unparseable or created/deleted
  manifest) refuses the auto-waiver fail-closed and the gate drifts normally.
  Path-level bypass is deliberately NOT the mechanism: it would exempt the whole
  manifest including the spec-binding metadata the gate exists to protect.
  Git-diff mode only (`--paths-from` carries no content). The freshness
  half of the dependabot story is spec 004 §3.5's governance-projection
  hashing, which keeps a dep-only bump from staling the committed index.
  **Spec 030 extends this mechanism** to two more ecosystems under the same
  opt-in flag: a `Cargo.toml` whose only change is dependency version
  specifiers, and a claimed `.github/workflows/*.yml` whose only change is the
  `@ref` of `uses:` action references. The whole-diff rule is unchanged (every
  non-bypassed path must be a recognized manifest whose change is
  dependency-only); the paired cargo freshness projection also lands in 004 §3.5.

### 3.6 Granularity reconciliation (the crate-spec vs file-establishes question)

Two ownership granularities coexist coherently:

- A crate's `[package.metadata.<ns>].spec` makes that spec the **whole-crate
  coverage floor**: every file under the package directory has at least that
  spec as an owner, so no code can be added to a governed crate with zero
  authority.
- Per-file `establishes` / per-unit `extends`/`refines`/`co_authority` **add**
  finer-grained owners on top of the floor.

Because any one owner clears and the owner set only ever expands, the natural
edit (touch the spec that established the file) always clears, while the floor
guarantees coverage for new or unclaimed files. The two are never in conflict.

### 3.7 Exit codes

| Result | Exit |
|---|---|
| no drift, or all drift waived | `0` |
| drift (uncovered changed paths), no waiver | `1` |
| committed index is stale (recompute the index first) | `2` |
| IO / parse / load failure | `3` |

`couple` / `couple_with` return `Ok(CoupleReport)` for any completed analysis
(clean, drift, or waived); the CLI maps the report to the exit code. Stale and
IO/parse/load are `Err` (exit 2 / 3). This keeps the JSON facade
(`couple_json`) returning the structured report even on drift.

### 3.8 Determinism

`couple_with` is a pure function of its inputs. Violations are sorted by path;
owner sets are `BTreeSet`-ordered. No clock, env, or git in core.

## 4. Out of scope

The indexer and unit resolution (spec 004). The `init` scaffolder (spec 006).

Span-backing source staleness is **in scope** as of Phase 4.5: the index
content-hash folds every source file behind a resolved `symbol`/`section` span
(spec 004 §3.5), so a source-line shift that moves a committed span forces the
index `Stale` and the gate refuses to run against stale spans (exit 2, recompute
first). What remains out of scope is **semantic** drift that preserves line spans
(e.g. a refactor that changes behavior without moving the owning symbol's lines):
the gate detects line-span coupling, not behavioral equivalence.
