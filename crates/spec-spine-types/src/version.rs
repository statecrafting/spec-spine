//! Schema-version constants: library-owned, started fresh at `0.1.0`.
//!
//! These are deliberately decoupled from the reference repos' version lines
//! (OAP registry `2.2.0`, index `3.0.0`). They are compile-time constants; in
//! Phase 2/3 the conformance tests assert that emitted JSON validates against the
//! embedded schema of the matching version, so a mismatch fails the build rather
//! than at runtime.
//!
//! Versioning policy (see `docs/design/00-architecture.md` §7 and, in Phase 5,
//! `docs/schema-versioning.md`): MINOR = additive only; MAJOR = breaking, and
//! loaders reject an unknown MAJOR. Under `0.x`, MINOR may break (SemVer `0.x`).
